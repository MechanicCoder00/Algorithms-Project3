BinaryTree.java

Purpose: A menu-driven program that creates a binary tree with data from project 3.  It then has selections to insert/delete/search nodes as well as determining the height of the binary tree.



PartB.java

Purpose: This program builds nine binary trees with different combinations of the amount of trees(5,10,15) and the amount of Nodes in the trees(100,500,1000).  The node values are random numbers between 1-10000 which have no duplicates. This program also uses functions from part A(BinaryTree.java).
